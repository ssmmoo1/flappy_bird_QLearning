#Q Learning For Flappy Bird

This project implements flappy bird using pygame and creates a Q-Learning agent that will self improve at playing the game. 
Running main will launch the game and the agent will begin playing very quickly. Every 100 games will slow down to be easily viewed. After a few hours it should be able to pass some pipes. 


pip install pygame

python3 main.py
